== What you'll learn
The use of microservices architecture may increase difficultly to see how services depend on or affect other services. Consequently, making it harder to find the source of latency or inaccuracy.

One way to increase observability of an application is by emitting traces. OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 adopts OpenTelemetry so your MicroProfile applications can benefit from both manual and automatic traces!

Traces represent requests and consist of multiple spans.
Spans are representative of single operations in a request and contain a name, time-related data, log messages and metadata to give information about what occurs during a transaction.

Context is an immutable object contained in the span data to identify the unique request that each span is a part of. This data is required for moving trace information across service boundaries, allowing developers to follow a single request through a potentially complex distributed system.
Exporters are components that send data to a backend service so you can visualise and monitor the generated spans.

You'll configure the provided inventory and system services to use Jaeger for distributed tracing with MicroProfile OpenTracing. You'll run these services in two separate JVMs made of two server instances to demonstrate tracing in a distributed environment. If all the components were run on a single server, then any logging software would be sufficient.

== Additional prerequisites 

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites. You can export the data that MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 collects to Jaeger. The Jaeger all-in-one executable file is configured for quick local testing. You can find information about the Jaeger server and instructions for starting the all-in-one executable file in the link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.22/getting-started/#all-in-one[Jaeger documentation]. Additionally, OpenTelemetry includes a simple logging exporter, which provides an easy way to check that spans are being created by viewing the data in your console. This may be helpful for debugging.

Before you proceed, make sure that your Jaeger server is up and running. Jaeger can be found at the http://localhost:16686 URL.

== Getting Started 
The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

```
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/draft-guide-microprofile-telemetry.git
cd draft-guide-microprofile-telemetry
```

The start directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The finish directory contains the finished project that you will build.

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites.

=== Try what you'll build

The finish directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

Open a command-line session and navigate to the finish/system directory. Run the following Maven goal to build the system service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

Start the system service:

```
cd system
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, your system service is ready:

```
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
```

Make sure that your Jaeger server is running and navigate to the system properties endpoint:

http://localhost:9080/system/properties

A span for this request will be created by the Java Agent. Check for the span in the exporter’s endpoint.

MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 allows you to observe traces without modifying source code in your Jakarta RESTful web service (aka JAX-RS) applications.
As you can see in the inventory service, you can enable mpTelemetry-1.0 in your server.xml:

```
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
```

By default, MicroProfile Telemetry tracing is off. To enable any tracing aspects, specify ```otel.sdk.disabled=false``` as a config property or ```OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false``` as an environment property for your server.

Open a new command-line session and navigate to the inventory directory:

```
cd inventory
```
Run the following Maven goal to build the inventory service and deploy it to Open Liberty:
```
mvn liberty:run
```
Navigate to the inventory endpoint:

http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost

You should see 3 spans in the exporter’s endpoint: two spans from inventory and one span from system.

Stop the inventory service by pressing ```Ctrl+c``` in the terminal session.

You have collected traces using the Java Agent and Automatic Instrumentation!

== Testing the services 

No automated tests are provided to verify the correctness of the traces. Manually verify these traces by viewing them on the Jaeger server.

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. These tests will run automatically as a part of the Maven build process when you run the `mvn install` command. You can also run these tests separately from the build by using the `mvn verify` command, but first make sure the servers are stopped.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in dev mode, run the tests for the system and inventory services by pressing the enter/return key in the command-line sessions where you started the services.

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing ```CTRL+C``` in the shell sessions where you ran the system and inventory services, or by typing ```q``` and then pressing the ```enter/return``` key.

Finally, stop the Jaeger service that you started in the Additional prerequisites section.
